## Fibonacci

Leonardo da Pisa (a.k.a. Fibonacci) was the son of a trader from Pisa. 
In 1192, he followed his father to Bejaia, Algeria, where he studied
the number systems the Arabs had brought from India. This is the decimal
system we use today.

In 1202 he published the *Liber Abaci* where he introduced the number system
that rapidly spread through Europe. The book contains a problem on the growth
of the growth of rabbits, giving raise to the famous Fibonacci's sequence.

## Many rabbits!

In a few years, the Earth would be scorched by hordes of rabbits!

$N_t = N_{t-1} + N_{t - 2}$

rabbits <- rep(0, nmonths)
rabbits[1:2] <- c(1,1)
for (i in 3:nmonths) rabbits[i] <- rabbits[i - 1] + rabbits[i - 2]

mytable <- matrix(0, 2, nmonths)
mytable[1, ] <- months
mytable[2, ] <- rabbits
rownames(mytable) <- c("Months", "Pairs")

```

## Geometric growth

The Swiss mathematician Euler (1707-1783) has left an indelible mark on science, publishing fundamental works in a number of mathematical disciplines. He became interested in the growth of populations because of what he read (and believed) in the Bible:

*These three were the sons of Noah; and from these the whole earth was peopled* (Genesis 9:19)

How long would it take to the sons of Noah to "people" the Earth? Euler considered the following model:

$N_t = (1 + x)N_{t-1}$

The number $x$ is called the *annual growth rate* of the population. Starting from a certain population size (i.e., knowing $N_0$), we can project forward:

$N_1 = (1 + x) N_0$

$N_2 = (1 + x) N_1 = (1 + x)^2 N_0$

$N_3 = (1 + x) N_2 = (1 + x)^3 N_0$

$\ldots$

## Geometric growth

In his treatise *Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite* (1748), Euler wrote:

*Since after the Flood all men descended from a population of six, if we suppose that the population after two hundred years was 1,000,000, we would like to find the annual rate of growth.*

Mathematically, you want to solve for $x$:

$N_{200} = (1 + x)^{200} N_0$

$10^6 = (1 + x)^{200} 6$

This sounds very easy to solve, but it is not, if you don't have a calculator! Euler exploited a very recent invention, the table of logarithms (introduced by Napier in 1614):

$\log_{10} (10^6) = \log_{10}((1 + x)^{200} 6)$

$(6 - log_{10}(6)) / 200 = \log_{10} (1 + x)$

yielding $x \approx 0.0619$, meaning about $6.2\%$ per year. Not an unrealistic result according to Euler, who concluded:

*For this reason, it is quite ridiculous for the incredulous to object that in such a short space of time the whole earth could not be populated beginning with a single man*

## Geometric growth?

Interestingly, Euler repeated his calculation projecting forward of 400 years (instead of 200), and found that it would lead to more that 166 billion humans. He noted:

*However, the whole earth would never be able to sustain that population.*

Hold this thought, as we're going to explore it later.

## Just how fast is geometric growth?

Meet *Escherichia coli*, a Gram-negative bacterium that lives in your intestine (and in many other places). Some strains of *E. coli* can cause serious food poisoning.

<div class="centered">
![ecoli](./images/EscherichiaColi.jpg) 
</div>

Under ideal conditions, it can reproduce every 20 minutes (72 times per day). Each cell weighs about $10^{-15}$kg.

We can write an equation for the mass of a population of *E. coli*, starting with a single bacterium, at time $d$ days:

$M_d = M_0 2^{72 d}$

and project forward

## *E. coli* colony growth

```{r echo = FALSE}
mass_earth <- 5.9721986 * 10^24
mass_sun <- 1.988435 *10^30
mass_solar <- 1.9912 * 10^30 
mass_universe <- 3.4 * 10^54
mass_you <- 70
m0 <- 10^(-12)
lm0 <- log(m0)
step <- 1 / 72
times <- seq(0, 3, by = step)
dfcoli <- data.frame(time = times, mass = exp(72 * times * log(2) + lm0))
require(ggplot2)
plcoli <- ggplot(dfcoli, aes(x = time, y = mass)) +

print(plcoli))
```

## Synchronized births

- Reproduction is synchronized in many animals

- Besides obvious seasonal effects, there might be more subtle causes leading to clustering in births

- These include phenological (i.e., pollinators hatch when plants are flowering), ecological (e.g., escape predators), and sociobiological (e.g., cooperative breeders)

- One of the most amazing cases is that of the banded mongoose (*Mungos mungo*): within a group, 64% of the births happen in the same night! (The reason for this is not very romantic: read Hodge *et al.* 2010)

## Continuous growth

$\Delta N = N_(t + \Delta t) - N_t$

$N_(t + \Delta t) = N_t (1 + x)$

$\Delta N = x N_t$

## Exponential growth

Define initial population $X(0) = X_0$. 

We model the **growth rate** of the population as:

$\dfrac{d X(t)}{d t} = r X(t)$

**Meaning:**

- $\dfrac{d X(t)}{d t}$ growth rate of population at time $t$. [units: Kg / time]

- $X(t)$ biomass (alternatively number of individuals, density per square Km, etc.) at time $t$. [units: Kg]

- $r$ intrinsic growth rate [units: 1 / time]. $r>0$ means the population grows, $r<0$ shrinks, $r=0$ is constant.

**Solution:**

$X(t) = X(0) e^{r t}$

- $e$ is Euler's number $2.718281828459045235360287471352...$

## Doubling time

How long before the population doubles in size?

$X(\tau) = 2 X(0)$

$X(\tau) = X(0) e^{r \tau} = 2 X(0)$

Independent of $X(0)>0$!

$e^{r \tau} = 2$

$r \tau = \log(2)$

$\tau = \frac{log(2)}{r} = \frac{0.301029995...}{r}$

Thus, if $r = 0.01$, then the population doubles every 30 years or so; $r = 0.05$, every 6 years; and so on.

## Halving time and carbon dating

Unstable atoms release energy through radioactive decay. This process is random, and, at the level of the single atom, cannot be predicted. However, we can measure statistically  the rate at which atoms decay. The Carbon isotope $\mathrm{^{14}C}$ is formed in the athmosphere when cosmic rays strike Nitrogen atoms:

$n + \mathrm{^{14}_{7}N} \rightarrow \mathrm{^{14}_{6}C} + p$

Radioactive carbon forms $\mathrm{CO}_2$ that is used by plants. Animals eat plants, etc. so that it is widely distributed in the biosphere. When an organism dies, it stops acquiring  $\mathrm{^{14}_{6}C}$. In the athmosphere/living organisms, there are about $1.5$ atoms of $\mathrm{^{14}C}$ for every $10^{12}$ of $\mathrm{^{12}C}$. The radioactive carbon loses an electron, and changes a proton into a neutron by emitting an electron antineutrino, resulting in Nitrogen. 

$\mathrm{~^{14}_{6}C}\rightarrow\mathrm{~^{14}_{7}N}+ e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$

In about 5730 years, half of the radioactive carbon has decayed. Hence, $r = -log(2)/5730 = 0.000052535...$. If a tissue has only $0.75$ parts of $\mathrm{^{14}C}$ for every $10^{12}$ of $\mathrm{^{12}C}$, the tissue is 5730 years old. A proportion of of $0.25 / 10^{12}$ would yield 34380 years, and so forth.

This method was proposed by Willard Libby (UofC) and collaborators in 1949. They were awarded the Nobel prize in 1960.

**Rabbits (again) **

- Lore has it, Thomas Austin released 24 rabbits in his property near Victoria (Australia) in 1859

- By 1886, the population had covered Victoria and New South Wales.

- In the 1920s, they were billions.

- Efforts to contain rabbits included building three rabbit-proof fences (failed), releasing the virus for mixomatosis and rabbit  haemorrhagic disease. Read Bergstrom *et al.* 2009 for a detailed account on Macquarie Island in Tasmania.
