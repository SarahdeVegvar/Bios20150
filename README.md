# Bios20150

Material for the ecology portion of the class BIOS 20150 *How Can We Understand the Biosphere?*, Spring of 2016.

## Downloading the material

There are two options:
- If you're familiar with `git`, simply `clone` the repository 
(if you're not familiar with `git`, but want to learn, here's a [short tutorial](http://goo.gl/H1qfgr)) 

- If you don't want to bother with `git`, you can download a [zip file](https://github.com/StefanoAllesina/Bios20150/archive/master.zip) containing all the material. 
The only downside is that whenever the material is updated, you will need to download the zip file again :-(
